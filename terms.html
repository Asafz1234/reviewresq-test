    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: November 2025</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the ReviewResQ website, dashboard, and related services ("Service"). By creating an account or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
    <p>ReviewResQ provides a feedback and review management tool for businesses. We help you collect feedback from your customers, route negative feedback away from public review platforms, and encourage happy customers to share their experiences on platforms such as Google Reviews.</p>

    <h2>2. No fake or manipulated reviews</h2>
    <p>The Service does not create, edit, or post reviews on your behalf. We do not sell or provide fake reviews. You are solely responsible for how you request and use feedback from your customers and for complying with all applicable laws and platform policies (including Google’s policies against fake or incentivized reviews).</p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years old and have the authority to enter into these Terms on behalf of your business.</p>

    <h2>4. Your account</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must provide accurate business, contact, and billing information.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Use of the Service</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use the Service to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Request or generate fake reviews or misrepresent customer experiences;</li>
      <li>Harass, spam, or mislead customers;</li>
      <li>Violate any law, regulation, or third-party policy (including Google, Facebook, or other platforms).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Payments and billing</h2>
    <p>Payments and subscriptions are processed by Paddle, our Merchant of Record. Paddle is responsible for billing, charging your payment method, handling taxes, and issuing invoices or receipts. By subscribing to a paid plan, you agree to Paddle’s terms and payment policies.</p>
    <p>Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled prior to the renewal date. You can cancel at any time through your account or via the link provided by Paddle. Cancellation stops future charges but does not automatically trigger a refund.</p>

    <h2>7. Free trials</h2>
    <p>If a free trial is offered, you will not be charged until the trial period ends. If you do not wish to continue, you must cancel before the trial expires.</p>

    <h2>8. No guarantee of results</h2>
    <p>We provide tools and workflows, but we do not and cannot guarantee any particular number of reviews, ratings, or customer responses. Outcomes depend on your business, your customers, and factors outside our control.</p>

    <h2>9. Customer data and feedback</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for obtaining any necessary consent from your customers before sending them feedback requests. You must not upload or share personal data that you are not legally allowed to use.</p>

    <h2>10. Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>The Service, including all branding, code, design, and content, is owned by ReviewResQ and its licensors. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Service for your internal business purposes while your subscription is active.</p>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time if you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Violate these Terms or applicable law,</li>
      <li>Use the Service to generate or promote fake or deceptive reviews,</li>
      <li>Fail to pay fees when due.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. Termination does not entitle you to a refund unless expressly provided by Paddle’s refund policy or applicable law.</p>

    <h2>12. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that it will meet your specific expectations.</p>

    <h2>13. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, ReviewResQ and its owners shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, or loss of profits or data, arising out of or in connection with your use of the Service.</p>
    <p>Our total aggregate liability for any claim related to the Service shall not exceed the amount of fees you paid for the Service in the 3 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</p>

    <h2>14. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless ReviewResQ from any claims, damages, or costs arising out of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your use of the Service,</li>
      <li>Your relationship with your customers,</li>
      <li>Your violation of these Terms or any law or third-party policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>15. Changes to the Service and Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update the Service or these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice (for example via email or in-app). Your continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

    <h2>16. Governing law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by applicable international contract principles. If required, disputes will be resolved in a competent court selected by the Service operator.</p>

    <h2>17. Contact</h2>
